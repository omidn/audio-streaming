** TODO notify when no microphone is detected.
** DONE fix the issue with unsensible open recognizer channels
** DONE clean-up the code and document it a bit.
** TODO try to find a way to handle the Telekom API audio data

** microsoft has its own streaming API, the same as google cloud's
** socket.io is a mucsh slower solution in comparision with node's raw sockets over tcp (~1/4 performance)
